!! Things that seem to not work yet

 * Nouns
    - also missing because of tones: (also these would be good to write tests to)
      - guri´´ga
      - guri´´gay´´ga
      - awr´´
      - awr´´ka
      - awr´
      - awr´ta

 * suprasegmental optional analysis:
    - ayuu (ayaa+CS+Foc/L+Subj+3SgM) does not analyse, but can be generated
    - ayuu´´ does analyze though.

General connecting thing here so far is tone marks are probably messing with
it. I can generate keen+V+Prog+1Sg+Ind+Pres (keen´a¨yaa), presenting
suprasegmentals, but analysis does not work (or does, but does not reveal this
analysis)
