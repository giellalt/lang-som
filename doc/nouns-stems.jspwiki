Nouns
-----

Nouns in Somali are things. They have separate paradigms depending on
morphophonological stuff, but are split up into subgroups which correspond
to gender polarity groups.

Note that items containing ATR should mark the ATR using <¨> before the vowel
or at the beginning of the stem if uncertain.
