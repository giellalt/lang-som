INTRODUCTION TO THE MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSER OF SOMALI.


 !!!Multichar_Symbols definitions

!!Analysis symbols

The morphological analyses of Somali wordforms are presented
in this system in terms of the following symbols.
(It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).

The parts-of-speech are:
 *  +N +V +A +Adp +Q +Pr +Adv +CC +CS +Interj +Pron +Num 



Fusional adpositions

 *  +Adp/u	   
 *  +Adp/ka   
 *  +Adp/la   
 *  +Adp/ku   

Focus

 * +Foc/L   Focus markers _baa_ and _ayaa_
 * +Foc/R   Focus marker _waxaa_

The parts of speech are further split up into:
 *  +Interr +Interr/ma +Attr +Short +Cmp     
 *  +Der/sho +Pfx +PP +Sep +Com		      
 *  +Appos +Impers +Inch				      

 *  +Recit +Restr						      

 *  +Pers								      
 *  +Dem								      
 *  +Coll								      
 *  +Mass								      
 *  +Acr								      
 *  +Abstr								      


Verb and noun declensions for the analysers that want to know about that

 *  +Decl/1 				      
 *  +Decl/2 +Decl/2A +Decl/2B    
 *  +Decl/3 +Decl/3A +Decl/3B    
 *  +Decl/4 				      
 *  +Decl/5				      
 *  +Decl/6 				      
 *  +Decl/7				      

The Usage extents are marked using the following tags:


The nominals are inflected in the following Case and Number

The possession is marked as such:
The comparative forms are:
Numerals are classified under:
Verb moods are:
Verb aspects are:
Verb personal forms are:
Other verb forms are

Special symbols are classified with:
The verbs are syntactically split according to transitivity:
Special multiword units are analysed with:
Non-dictionary words can be recognised with:

Question and Focus particles:


Semantics are classified with


Derivations are classified under the morphophonetic form of the suffix, the
source and target part-of-speech.


And some things that I haven't moved up to other categories yet...





Syntaxy stuff, don't want to use +Acc, because this isn't relevant in nouns

Nominal MSP

Derivation


Clitics




Style 




!!Morphophonology

To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
symbols in the lexicon files:

!Verb declensions
 * {N}   

Going to try to replace these with flag diacritics if possible.

TODO: this is in use, but might be better to do a flag diacritic

 * {PREFIXING}   

And following triggers to control variation

 * {PROG}		    
 * %			    
 * %>			    

 * {#} {##} -      

TODO: no need for , but needs to be removed in all files

 *  {t} {o} {m} {mm} {C2} {d} {X} {ae} {e} {-e} {a} {-VV} {-V} {-I} {-w} {-a}  

 *  {E}   part of cliticized ee (CS+Appos)

 *  {ea}   aabbe - aabbaha
 *  {m}   
 *  {y}   
 *  {ATR}  

Tone 


 * !  ´       Trond: this is not a multichar symbol
 *  ´´      

We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics:

!!!The continuation lexica

 * LEXICON Root    

The word forms in Somali start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes, or optionally from prefixes:

 * Abbreviations   ;   

 * Nouns           ;   
 * Numerals        ;   

 * Pronouns        ;   

 * Verbs           ;    
 * Adjectives      ;    Some have verb morphology, and some view them to just be a 4th declension of verbs. 

 * Adverbs         ;   

 * Conjunctions    ;   
 * Subjunctions    ;   

 * Postpositions   ;   
 * Determiners     ;   
 * Interjections   ;   
 * Punctuation     ;   

!!The following are coming from som-lex.txt
* IrregularNounMorph ; 
* VerbalPrefixes ;	    
* IrregularAdjective ; 
* Adverb ;			    
* Prefixes  ;		    

 * LEXICON FINAL_NG  just adds the +Use/NG tag to lower ##

 * LEXICON FINAL  just adds lower ##




These lexica are dummy lexical to make the source compile, they contain only #.
